# TheseBM

To get started with the development, install XAMPP and copy the repository to the root folder

**Windows**

```
git clone git@github.com:Zorbiks/TheseBM.git C:/xampp/htdocs/TheseBM
```

**GNU/Linux**

```
git clone git@github.com:Zorbiks/TheseBM.git
```

**Note**: For GNU/Linux make sure that you change the ```DocumentRoot``` option located in ```/opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf``` to another directory otherwise root permission is required

**Example**
```
# 
# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
#
DocumentRoot "/home/user/www"
<Directory "/home/user/www">
```
